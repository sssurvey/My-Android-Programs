###### All my Android apps in one place.
## Whats this repository for?
###### In this repository, I will be re-write some of the projects I did in the last semester. Most of the Android project in the last semester is completed in a hurry, and some of the projects are not fully implemented with less satisfactory UI and bad code implementation. In this repository, I will be fixing mistakes in the previous project, re-develop and distribute them in a better way.

## The project in last semster include:
#### 1. Convertor

><b>App Requirements</b>
>>The app should allow the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. No other conversions should be allowed, and one conversion must be selected at any given time (no situation where no conversion is selected).
>>
>>Your Activity must use a Constraint Layout.
>>
>>User the following formulae for conversion:
>>>T(°C) = (T(°F) – 32.0) × 5.0/9.0 o T(°F) = (T(°C) × 9.0/5.0) + 32.0
>>
>>The initial temperature value should be entered by the user (see images below).
>>
>>Pressing a Convert button should calculate the converted temperature value and display it on the screen. Converted values should be displayed out to 1 decimal place only.
>>
>>The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history” (most recent conversions at the top of the history, history must be scrollable when many entries are present):
>>
>>Example:
>>>>F to C: 55.0 -> 12.8
>>>>C to F: 3.5 -> 38.3
>>
>>The app must look and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation.
